# EPollingApp

This app will recreate the polling process during elections, but with a twist. The app should:
Include a sign-up form to register a new poll user.
Check whether the user qualifies to poll (over 18 years, has no (fictional) criminal records, etc.).
Offer 5-10 poll options to choose from.
Display results of the ‘election’.
